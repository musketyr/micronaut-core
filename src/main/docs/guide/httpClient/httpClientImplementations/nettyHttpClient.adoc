== Disable hostname verification in ssl config

It may be necessary in a testing or development environment to disable hostname verification.

To disable hostname verification in your test classpath, you could create a <<replaces, Bean Replacement>> in `src/test/java`:

[source,java]
----
include::http-client/src/test/java/io/micronaut/http/client/netty/ssl/NettyClientSslBuilderReplacement.java[indent=0]
----
WARNING: Disabling host name verification leaves your application potentially vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle attacks and should only be done with the utmost care typically only in a development / testing environment. Never disable host name verification in production or in a scenario where you are making remote calls over the internet.
