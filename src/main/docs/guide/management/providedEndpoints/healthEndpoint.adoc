The health endpoint returns information about the "health" of the application, which is determined by any number of "health indicators".

Send a GET request to `/health` to execute the health endpoint. Additionally, the health endpoint exposes `/health/liveness` and `/health/readiness` health indicators.

A positive liveness check (`/health/liveness`) means the application is running and not stuck. If it fails, the application might need to be restarted.

A positive readiness check (`/health/readiness`) means the application is fully initialized and ready to handle requests.
