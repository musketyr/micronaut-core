To configure the health endpoint, supply configuration through `endpoints.health`.

.Health Endpoint Configuration Example
[configuration]
----
endpoints:
  health:
    enabled: Boolean
    sensitive: Boolean
    details-visible: String
    status:
      http-mapping: Map<String, HttpStatus>
----

- `details-visible` is one of api:management.endpoint.health.DetailsVisibility[]

The `details-visible` setting controls whether health detail will be exposed to users who are not authenticated. If the details-visible parameter is configured as ANONYMOUS, while the sensitive flag is set to true, the resulting outcome will be 401 Unauthorized.

For example, setting:

.Using `details-visible`
[configuration]
----
endpoints:
  health:
    details-visible: ANONYMOUS
----

exposes detailed information from the various health indicators about the health status of the application to anonymous unauthenticated users.
