The health endpoint consists of a health aggregator and any number of health indicators. To add a health indicator, create a bean class that implements link:{api}/io/micronaut/management/health/indicator/HealthIndicator.html[HealthIndicator]. It is recommended to also use either link:{api}/io/micronaut/management/health/indicator/annotation/Liveness.html[@Liveness] or link:{api}/io/micronaut/management/health/indicator/annotation/Readiness.html[@Readiness] qualifier. If no qualifier is used, the health indicator will be part of /health and /health/readiness endpoints. A base class link:{api}/io/micronaut/management/health/indicator/AbstractHealthIndicator.html[AbstractHealthIndicator] is available to subclass to make the process easier.

All health indicator beans are collected together with the health aggregator. To provide your own implementation of the health aggregator, create a class that implements link:{api}/io/micronaut/management/health/aggregator/HealthAggregator.html[HealthAggregator] and register it as a bean. To ensure your implementation is used instead of the default, add the link:{api}/io/micronaut/context/annotation/Replaces.html[@Replaces] annotation to your class with the value being the default implementation api:management.health.aggregator.DefaultHealthAggregator[].

The default health aggregator returns an overall status calculated based on the health statuses of the indicators. A link:{api}/io/micronaut/health/HealthStatus.html[health status] consists of several pieces of information.

|=======
|Name |The name of the status
|Description |The description of the status
|Operational |Whether the functionality the indicator represents is functional
|Severity |How severe the status is. A higher number is more severe
|=======

The "worst" status is returned as the overall status. A non-operational status is selected over an operational status. A higher severity is selected over a lower severity.
